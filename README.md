That's excellent\! Since your mini-project is a **Python CLI utility for File and Exception Handling** using the `pathlib` and `os` modules, I'll generate a tailored README file for it.

This README focuses on the purpose of the project, how to run it, and highlights the core concepts it demonstrates.

# üìÇ File Operations CLI Utility

[](https://www.python.org/)

## üí° About The Project

This project is a **Mini-Project demonstrating fundamental Python concepts** in File Handling and Exception Management. It provides a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows a user to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on files within the current directory.

The primary goals of this utility are to illustrate:

  * **File Handling:** Using Python's built-in `open()` function with various modes (`'w'`, `'r'`, `'a'`).
  * **Path Management:** Leveraging the modern `pathlib.Path` module for robust file system interactions (checking existence, renaming, and reading file information).
  * **Exception Handling:** Implementing `try...except` blocks to gracefully manage common errors like `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and invalid user input (`ValueError`).

### Built With

  * Python 3.x
  * `pathlib` (Standard Library)
  * `os` (Standard Library)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You only need **Python 3.8 or newer** installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gitdhruv-tech/CRUD-on-File.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CRUD-on-File
    ```
3.  **Ensure the main script is present:**
    The file containing the code (e.g., main.py or similar) should be in this directory.

-----

## üèÉ Usage

Run the script directly from your terminal. The application will start and present the main menu.

```bash
python main.py
```

### Main Menu Operations

The utility provides the following functions:

| Menu Option | Function | Demonstrates |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Create a file | Using `open(..., 'w')` and path existence checks. |
| **2** | Read a file | Using `open(..., 'r')` and handling `FileNotFoundError`. |
| **3** | Update a file | File renaming (`.rename()`), content overwriting (`'w'`), and appending (`'a'`). |
| **4** | Delete a file | Using `Path.unlink()` or `os.remove()` to delete a file. |
| **5** | Exit | Terminates the program loop. |

**Note:** All file operations are performed relative to the directory where you execute the script.
